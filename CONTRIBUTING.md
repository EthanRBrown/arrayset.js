## Contributing

This is a small library without a lot of activity, so generally I'll accept any reasonable enhancements. If there are big changes you would like to see, please raise an issue first to discuss.

1. Fork repository
2. Make code changes & write tests (in [src/**tests**](src/__tests__))
3. Make sure all tests pass (`pnpm test`)
4. Make sure build is successful (`pnpm build`)
5. Update [README.md](README.md) with documentation (if necessary)

Do not update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); the maintainer will do that with version releases.
