# v1.0.11

* Switches to `tsc` for build output; now TypeScript declaration files are emitted
* Tests now include source code and built output

# v1.0.10

* Adds `fromArray` method to create arrayset instance from JavaScript array (removing duplicates).  Thanks to @alspdx for the work!
* Update to dependencies to pass `yarn audit`

# v1.0.9

Erroneous release that was intended to included the `fromArray` method, but I botched the merge & didn't end up
pushing the changes as intended.

# Older Versions

Added this file as part of v1.0.9 release...older release history is undocumented.
